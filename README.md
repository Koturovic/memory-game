# Memory Game

This is a classic memory game where players flip two cards at a time to find matching pairs.  
The game is built using **HTML, CSS, and jQuery**, where **HTML** structures the game board, **CSS** styles the elements, and **jQuery** handles user interactions and animations.  
Images are dynamically assigned and shuffled using JavaScript to ensure a randomized gameplay experience.  
Once all pairs are found, the game displays a victory message to the player.
